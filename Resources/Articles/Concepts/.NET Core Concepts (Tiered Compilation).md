# .NET Core Concepts (Tiered Compilation)

This article focuses on Tiered Compilation and Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) configuration. There are great and detailed resources on what Tiered Compilation and PGO in .NET Core are and how they work. Some are listed in the [References](#references) section below.

## Concepts

Tiered Compilation allows the .NET runtime to substitute different assembly code method implementations for the same method during the lifetime of an application to achieve higher performance. Tiered Compilation first divides all code into two buckets. Code that is eligible for tiering and code that is not. Code that is not eligible is not affected by Tiered Compilation or PGO. Code that is eligible can have two major and several minor variations called tiers:

* Tier 0: This is JIT-generated code using minimal optimizations.
* Tier 0 Instrumented: This is Tier 0 code with PGO instrumentation.
* Tier 1 with Static PGO: This is ReadyToRun precompiled code.
* Tier 1 Instrumented with Static PGO: This is ReadyToRun precompiled code with PGO instrumentation.
* Tier 1 without PGO: This is JIT-generated code using additional optimizations when Dynamic PGO is turned off.
* Tier 1 with Dynamic PGO: This is either JIT-generated or ReadyToRun code with additional optimizations based on Dynamic PGO.
* Tier 1 with On-Stack Replacement (OSR): This is JIT-generated code with additional optimizations which is used as a temporary replacement for methods with loops or backward jumps.
* Tier 1 with Minimal Optimizations: This option is the same as Tier 0 except that the code is not subject to further tiering and instrumentation.

Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) is a compiler optimization feature. In the context of .NET Core there are two types of PGOs:

* Static PGO: This is compile-time optimization analysis.
* Dynamic PGO: This is runtime-based optimization analysis that uses instrumentation to gather method execution statistics. Dynamic PGO in the context of Tiered Compilation is also referred to as Tiered PGO.

## Prerequisites

Before we look at the Tiered Compilation and Dynamic PGO configuration, let's review the following code snippet:

```
protected override void Execute()
{
    // Part 1
    int[] values = [.. Enumerable.Range(0, 1_000)];
    var multiplier = 42;
    GetValuesMultiply(values, multiplier);
    Console.ReadKey(true);
    // Part 2
    for (var i = 1; i <= 30; i++)
        GetValuesMultiply(values, multiplier);
    Console.ReadKey(true);
    // Part 3
    for (var i = 1; i <= 30; i++)
        GetValuesMultiply(values, multiplier);
    Console.ReadKey(true);
}

[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
private static int GetValuesMultiply(int[] values, int multiplier) => GetValuesSum(values, i => i * multiplier);

private static int GetValuesSum(int[] values, Func<int, int> func)
{
    var result = 0;
    foreach (var value in values)
        result += func(value);
    return result;
}
```

The `Execute()` method is divided into three parts - the first one calls the `GetValuesMultiply()` method once and the second and third parts call the `GetValuesMultiply()` method 30 times in a loop. The `GetValuesMultiply()` method in turn calls the `GetValuesSum()` method to calculate a sum of array of integers using a constant multiplication lambda function. The `GetValuesMultiply()` method is marked with `[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]` attribute to prevent the JIT compiler from inlining the function and better illustrate the configuration scenarios later in this article.

There are several approaches that we can use to analyze the impact of various Tiered Compilation and Dynamic PGO options. We can capture core dumps at different points in the application execution and inspect the MethodDescriptors for the `GetValuesMultiply()` and `GetValuesSum()`, but this approach is too complicated for the purpose of this article. We can also use `export DOTNET_JitDisasmSummary=1` to print all JIT-ed methods to the console, but we have to sift through a lot of methods to find the ones we are interested in.

In this case we will focus on `GetValuesMultiply()` and `GetValuesSum()` by setting the following environment variable before running our sample code:

```export DOTNET_JitDisasm="ByteZoo.Blog.App.Controllers.Concepts.TieredCompilationController:GetValues*"```

## Configuration Options

The following are the major configuration options (environment variables) related to Tiered Compilation and Dynamic PGO:

* DOTNET_TieredCompilation: This option enables (`1`) or disables (`0`) both the Tiered Compilation and Dynamic PGO features. If disabled, the generated code contains all static optimizations. The default value is enabled (`1`).
* DOTNET_TieredPGO: This option enables (`1`) or disables (`0`) the Dynamic PGO feature. The default value is enabled (`1`).
* DOTNET_TC_AggressiveTiering: This option enables (`1`) or disables (`0`) the aggressive tiering transitions. Enabling this option is equivalent to setting `DOTNET_TC_CallCountThreshold=1` and `DOTNET_TC_CallCountingDelayMs=0`. The default value is disabled (`0`).
* DOTNET_TC_CallCountThreshold: This option specifies the number of method invocations between a single tier transition. The default value is 30 times.
* DOTNET_TC_CallCountingDelayMs: This option specifies the delay after the last method JIT compilation during application startup before call counting can begin. The default value is 100 ms.
* DOTNET_JITMinOpts: This option enables (`1`) or disables (`0`) minimal code optimizations mode. If enabled, both Tiered Compilation and Dynamic PGO are turned off and the generated code contains minimal optimizations. The default value is disabled (`0`).

## Configuration Scenarios

**Scenario 1**: Use default settings (Tiered Complication = On, Dynamic PGO = On). If we run our sample application without specifying any of the configuration options or using the default values, we get the following results:

Output:

**Scenario 2**: Disable Both Tiered Complication & Dynamic PGO (Tiered Complication = Off, Dynamic PGO = Off, `DOTNET_TieredCompilation=0`). We run the sample application using the following:

```export DOTNET_TieredCompilation=0```

Output:
```
; Assembly listing for method ByteZoo.Blog.App.Controllers.Concepts.TieredCompilationController:GetValuesMultiply(int[],int):int (FullOpts)
; Emitting BLENDED_CODE for X64 with AVX - Unix
; FullOpts code

; optimized code
; rbp based frame
; partially interruptible
; No PGO data

```

In this scenario, the output shows that both `GetValuesMultiply()` and `GetValuesSum()` were complied directly into Tier 1 without PGO.

**Scenario 3**: Disable Dynamic PGO Only (Tiered Complication = On, Dynamic PGO = Off, `DOTNET_TieredPGO=0`). We run the sample application using the following:

```
export DOTNET_TieredCompilation=
export DOTNET_TieredPGO=0
```

Output:
```
; Assembly listing for method ByteZoo.Blog.App.Controllers.Concepts.TieredCompilationController:GetValuesMultiply(int[],int):int (Tier0)
; Emitting BLENDED_CODE for X64 with AVX - Unix
; Tier0 code

; rbp based frame
; partially interruptible
...

; Assembly listing for method ByteZoo.Blog.App.Controllers.Concepts.TieredCompilationController:GetValuesSum(int[],System.Func`2[int,int]):int (Tier1-OSR)
; Emitting BLENDED_CODE for X64 with AVX - Unix
; Tier1-OSR code
; OSR variant for entry point 0x1a
; optimized code
; rbp based frame
; partially interruptible

; Tier1 code
; optimized code
; rbp based frame
; partially interruptible
; No PGO data
; 1 inlinees with PGO data; 2 single block inlinees; 0 inlinees without PGO data
...

; Assembly listing for method ByteZoo.Blog.App.Controllers.Concepts.TieredCompilationController:GetValuesSum(int[],System.Func`2[int,int]):int (Tier1)
; Emitting BLENDED_CODE for X64 with AVX - Unix
; Tier1 code
; optimized code
; rbp based frame
; partially interruptible
; No PGO data
...
```

The output shows that the `GetValuesMultiply()` method went through the following tiers - Tier 0 and Tier 1 Optimized without PGO. For the `GetValuesSum()` method, the tiers were - Tier 0 Instrumented, Tier 1 OSR, Tier 0 Instrumented, Tier 1 OSR, Tier 1 Optimized without PGO.

**Scenario 4**: Disable All Optimizations (Tiered Complication = Off, Dynamic PGO = Off, `DOTNET_JITMinOpts=1`). We run the sample application using the following:

```export DOTNET_JITMinOpts=1```

Output:
```
; Assembly listing for method ByteZoo.Blog.App.Controllers.Concepts.TieredCompilationController:GetValuesMultiply(int[],int):int (MinOpts)
; Emitting BLENDED_CODE for X64 with AVX - Unix
; MinOpts code
; rbp based frame
; partially interruptible
...

; Assembly listing for method ByteZoo.Blog.App.Controllers.Concepts.TieredCompilationController:GetValuesSum(int[],System.Func`2[int,int]):int (MinOpts)
; Emitting BLENDED_CODE for X64 with AVX - Unix
; MinOpts code
; rbp based frame
; partially interruptible
...
```

In this scenario, the output shows that both `GetValuesMultiply()` and `GetValuesSum()` were complied directly into Tier 1 with Minimal Optimizations.

## Conclusion

The `DOTNET_TC_AggressiveTiering`, `DOTNET_TC_CallCountThreshold` and `DOTNET_TC_CallCountingDelayMs` options can be used to fine-tune the application startup time or the interval until a steady-state is reached. Steady-state is when most critical methods are compiled and fully optimized.

`DOTNET_TieredCompilation`, `DOTNET_TieredPGO` and `DOTNET_JITMinOpts` can be used during testing or core dump analysis where you need stable results that are not affected by changes introduced by Tiered Compilation or Dynamic PGO. E.g. you are comparing core dumps of the same process at different points in time.
