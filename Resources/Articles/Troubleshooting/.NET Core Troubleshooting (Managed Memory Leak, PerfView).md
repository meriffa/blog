# .NET Core Troubleshooting (Managed Memory Leak, PerfView)

This article outlines the steps to troubleshoot Managed Memory Leak issue in a .NET Core application using [PerfView](https://github.com/microsoft/perfview). The article reuses both the sample code and core dumps from [Managed Memory Leak](/Resources/Articles/Troubleshooting/.NET%20Core%20Troubleshooting%20(Managed%20Memory%20Leak).md), but contains an alternative method to analyze the issue using PerfView instead of [LLDB](https://lldb.llvm.org/) and [SOS Debugging Extension](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/sos-debugging-extension).

## Problem

The source code for the Managed Memory Leak application issue, which we will investigate, is located at:

[ManagedMemoryController.cs](https://github.com/meriffa/blog/blob/main/Sources/ByteZoo.Blog.App/Controllers/Scenarios/Leaks/ManagedMemoryController.cs)

As with the previous article, the function `StartMemoryConsumptionTask()` allocates batches of `Employee` instances, which results in unlimited managed heap growth.

## Prerequisites

Before we investigate the Managed Memory Leak in PerfView, we need to install PerfView on a Windows machine. You can clone the source code repository and build the tool, or you can just download the latest release from:

[PerfView Releases](https://github.com/microsoft/perfview/releases)

Next we need to generate heap snapshot (.gcDump) files from the core dumps. In PerfView, select "Memory" -> "Take Heap Snapshot From Dump", specify the input core dump file in "Process Dump File", the output heap snapshots "Output Data File" and then select "Dump GC Heap".

Generate a corresponding heap snapshot (.gcDump) file for each core dump.

## Analysis

We start the Managed Memory Leak analysis by loading the Heap Stacks from both heap snapshot (.gcDump) files. In PerfView, double-click on a heap snapshot (.gcDump) file in the navigation tree and then double-click the "Heap Stacks" option.

First Core Dump:
![Figure 2.png](/Resources/Images/.NET%20Core%20Troubleshooting%20(Managed%20Memory%20Leak,%20PerfView)%20-%20Figure%202.png)

The Heap Stacks view shows that most of the objects allocated are `System.String` instances (95% overall, 12,026,400 bytes, 1,200 instances).

> [!NOTE]
> The PerfView statistics differ from the SOS statistics since PerfView uses sampling and scaling to reduce the size of the heap snapshot (.gcDump) file.

Second Core Dump:
![Figure 3.png](/Resources/Images/.NET%20Core%20Troubleshooting%20(Managed%20Memory%20Leak,%20PerfView)%20-%20Figure%203.png)

The Heap Stacks view shows that most of the objects allocated are again `System.String` instances (96.4% overall, 18,039,600 bytes, 1,800 instances).

Next, we need to identify the source(s) of the Managed Memory Leak. To do that, select the Heap Stacks view for the second core dump, select "Diff" -> "With Baseline: Heap Stacks (First Core Dump)". This will display a Diff Heap Stacks view as follows:

![Figure 4.png](/Resources/Images/.NET%20Core%20Troubleshooting%20(Managed%20Memory%20Leak,%20PerfView)%20-%20Figure%204.png)

Diff Heap Stacks view clearly shows that memory growth is driven almost entirely by `System.String` instances (99.5% overall, 6,013,200 bytes, 600 instances). If there were multiple sources of managed memory growth, the values in `Exc %` column would be distributed across multiple types.

The last step in this analysis is to find the GC root chains of the `System.String` instances that cause the managed memory growth. To do that, double-click the `LIB <<System.Private.CoreLib!String (Bytes > 10K)>>` row in the Diff Heap Stacks view and set the check boxes for all roots:

![Figure 5.png](/Resources/Images/.NET%20Core%20Troubleshooting%20(Managed%20Memory%20Leak,%20PerfView)%20-%20Figure%205.png)

Diff Heap Stacks view shows that the `System.String` instances are referenced by `PersonName` (66.3%) and `Employee` (33.2%) objects. All objects are kept alive by `Workforce<Employee>` instance, which in turn is referenced by the `[StrongHandle]` instance.

> [!NOTE]
> `[StrongHandle]` instance represents the strong handle table that keeps the static fields alive, which is part of the CLR itself.

## Conclusion

The analysis again shows that there is a Managed Memory Leak caused by unlimited growth of `System.String` instances that are kept alive by a `Workforce<Employee>` static variable. In this case, PerfView shows a more granular view of the GC root chains between `System.String` and `Workforce<Employee>` (e.g. the distribution between the `PersonName` and `Employee` intermediate roots).
