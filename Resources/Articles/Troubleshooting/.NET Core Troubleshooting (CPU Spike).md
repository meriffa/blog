# .NET Core Troubleshooting (CPU Spike)

This article outlines the steps for capturing a core dump to troubleshoot intermittent CPU spikes in a .NET Core application.

## Problem

A CPU spike is usually a short-term jump in processor utilization. This article uses the same approach as defined in the previous [High CPU Usage](/Resources/Articles/Troubleshooting/.NET%20Core%20Troubleshooting%20(High%20CPU%20Usage).md) troubleshooting article.

Figure 1 below shows application CPU utilization with a single CPU spike of 494% at time interval T4.

Figure 2 below shows the `top` command output for the target .NET Core application at time interval T4.

> [!NOTE]
> The CPU utilization is more than 100%, since the value is the sum of the utilization values across all CPU cores. There are eight CPU cores in this case (CPU0-CPU7).

To troubleshoot a CPU spike, we need to capture a core dump during the spike.

## Prerequisites

Capturing a core dump in general is described in [Create .NET Core Dumps On Linux](/Resources/Articles/Prerequisites/Create%20.NET%20Core%20Dumps%20On%20Linux.md).

## Analysis

To capture the CPU spike, we will use a shell script to monitor the CPU utilization of a .NET Core application using a particular threshold. Once this threshold is reached, the script will capture a core dump for analysis.

> [!NOTE]
> The full shell script is available at [CreateDump.sh](/Resources/Scripts/CreateDump.sh).

First, we add the CPU utilization value capture function as follows:

```
GetCpuUtilization() {
  [[ -f "/proc/$1/status" ]] && echo $(top -b -n 1 -p $1 | tail -1 | awk '{print $9}') || echo ""
}
```

Next, we create a CPU utilization threshold monitoring function as follows:

```
WaitForCpuUtilizationThreshold() {
  echo "Waiting for CPU utilization to reach the specified threshold (PID = $1, CPU = $2%)."
  while : ; do
    local CPU_UTILIZATION=$(GetCpuUtilization $1)
    if [ "$CPU_UTILIZATION" == "" ]; then
      return -1;
    fi
    if (( $(echo "$CPU_UTILIZATION >= $2" | bc -l) )); then
      echo "CPU utilization threshold reached (PID = $1, CPU = $CPU_UTILIZATION%)."
      return 0;
    fi
    echo "Current CPU utilization (PID = $1, CPU = $CPU_UTILIZATION%)."
    sleep $FLAG_INTERVAL
  done
}
```

The `WaitForCpuUtilizationThreshold()` function will monitor the CPU utilization threshold and once reached it will return success (`0`).

Last, we can run the final script to capture the CPU spike core dump using:

```CreateDump.sh -n ByteZoo.Blog.App -c 480 -interval 1.0```

Output:
```
Waiting for CPU utilization to reach the specified threshold (PID = 4874, CPU = 480%).
Current CPU utilization (PID = 4874, CPU = 9.8%).
Current CPU utilization (PID = 4874, CPU = 16.1%).
Current CPU utilization (PID = 4874, CPU = 11.2%).
CPU utilization threshold reached (PID = 4874, CPU = 494.0%).
.NET Core dump created (PID = 4874, File = './CoreDump_Full.4874').
```

The script output shows that a core dump (`CoreDump_Full.4874`) was created when exceeding the CPU utilization threshold of 480%.

## Conclusion

The goal of this article is to provide a method for capturing a core dump for CPU spike troubleshooting that is as straightforward as possible. It uses the `top` command available on all Linux distributions. For further analysis of the CPU spike core dump see the [High CPU Usage](/Resources/Articles/Troubleshooting/.NET%20Core%20Troubleshooting%20(High%20CPU%20Usage).md) article.

> The CPU monitoring approach in this article might not work for very short (under 100 ms) CPU spikes.
