# .NET Core Troubleshooting (Memory Spike)

This article outlines the steps for capturing a core dump to troubleshoot intermittent memory spikes in a .NET Core application.

## Problem

Memory spikes are intermittent jumps in memory utilization as opposed to gradual memory increases typical of memory leaks. Memory spikes can be a symptom of improper resource use, long-term memory leak or application logic errors dependent on a particular set of parameters.

Figure 1 below shows application memory usage with a single memory spike.

In this case, the regular memory usage is around 65 MB (intervals T1, T2, T3, T4, T7 and T8) and a memory spike of over 100 MB (intervals T5 and T6). In other cases, there could be several or even regular interval memory spikes. In all cases, the approach is virtually the same.

Similar to the troubleshooting method outlined in [Managed Memory Leak](/Resources/Articles/Troubleshooting/.NET%20Core%20Troubleshooting%20(Managed%20Memory%20Leak).md), we need to capture at least two core dumps. The first core dump will be used as a baseline and can be captured either before or after the memory spike. The second core dump must be captured during the memory spike.

Capturing the baseline core dump is trivial and can be done at any time. For more details, see [Create .NET Core Dumps On Linux](/Resources/Articles/Prerequisites/Create%20.NET%20Core%20Dumps%20On%20Linux.md).

This article focuses on the time-sensitive core dump captured during the memory spike.

## Prerequisites

Before we look at capturing the memory spike core dump, let's look at the [/proc/pid/status](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc_pid_status.5.html) memory facility on Linux:

```cat /proc/$$/status | grep -E "(Vm|Rss)[^:]+:"```

Output:
```
VmPeak:	    8244 kB
VmSize:	    8244 kB
VmLck:	       0 kB
VmPin:	       0 kB
VmHWM:	    5000 kB
VmRSS:	    5000 kB
RssAnon:    1564 kB
RssFile:    3436 kB
RssShmem:      0 kB
VmData:	    1616 kB
VmStk:	     132 kB
VmExe:	     772 kB
VmLib:	    1588 kB
VmPTE:	      60 kB
VmSwap:	       0 kB
```

In the context of troubleshooting .NET Core applications, we focus on the following memory statistics:

* `Used` (`VmRSS` + `VmSwap`): This is the sum of `VmRSS` and `VmSwap` (same as the `USED` field in `top` command). This metric shows the overall application usage (both physical and swap memory).
* `VmRSS`: Resident set size. The value is the sum of `RssAnon`, `RssFile` and `RssShmem`. In simple terms, this represents physical memory application usage.
* `RssAnon`: Size of resident anonymous memory.
* `RssFile`: Size of resident file mappings.
* `RssShmem`: Size of resident shared memory.
* `VmData`: Size of data segments.
* `VmStk`: Size of stack segments.
* `VmExe`: Size of text (code) segments.

> [!NOTE]
> For more accurate resident values (`VmRSS`, `RssAnon`, `RssFile` and `RssShmem`) see [/proc/pid/statm](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc_pid_statm.5.html).

In most cases, monitoring `Used` or `VmRSS` thresholds is sufficient to troubleshoot memory spikes in .NET Core applications. If you have more information about the source of a specific memory spike, you can also use `RssAnon` or `VmData` thresholds.

## Analysis

We will create a shell script which will monitor our .NET Core application using a particular memory statistic threshold. Once this threshold is reached, the script will capture a core dump to be used to compare the memory allocations against a baseline core dump captured before or after the memory spike core dump.

> [!NOTE]
> The full shell script is available at [CreateDump.sh](/Resources/Scripts/CreateDump.sh).

First we add the memory statistic value capture function as follows:

```
GetMemoryAllocation() {
  case "${1,,}" in
    "virtual") [[ -f "/proc/$2/status" ]] && echo $(grep VmSize /proc/$2/status | awk '{print $2}') || echo "" ;;
    "resident") [[ -f "/proc/$2/status" ]] && echo $(grep VmRSS /proc/$2/status | awk '{print $2}') || echo "" ;;
    "residentanonymous") [[ -f "/proc/$2/status" ]] && echo $(grep RssAnon /proc/$2/status | awk '{print $2}') || echo "" ;;
    "residentshared") [[ -f "/proc/$2/status" ]] && echo $(grep RssShmem /proc/$2/status | awk '{print $2}') || echo "" ;;
    "swap") [[ -f "/proc/$2/status" ]] && echo $(grep VmSwap /proc/$2/status | awk '{print $2}') || echo "" ;;
    "used") [[ -f "/proc/$2/status" ]] && echo $(($(grep VmRSS /proc/$2/status | awk '{print $2}') + $(grep VmSwap /proc/$2/status | awk '{print $2}'))) || echo "" ;;
    "shared") [[ -f "/proc/$2/status" ]] && echo $(($(grep RssFile /proc/$2/status | awk '{print $2}') + $(grep RssShmem /proc/$2/status | awk '{print $2}'))) || echo "" ;;
    "code") [[ -f "/proc/$2/status" ]] && echo $(grep VmExe /proc/$2/status | awk '{print $2}') || echo "" ;;
    "data") [[ -f "/proc/$2/status" ]] && echo $(grep VmData /proc/$2/status | awk '{print $2}') || echo "" ;;
    *) echo "" ;;
  esac
}
```

The `GetMemoryAllocation()` function can be used as:

```GetMemoryAllocation "Used" 1234```

where `1234` is the .NET Core application process id and `Used` is the type of memory statistic to capture.

Next, we create a memory threshold monitoring function as follows:

```
WaitForMemoryAllocationThreshold() {
  local MEMORY_TYPE=$(GetMemoryTypeText $3)
  [[ -z $MEMORY_TYPE ]] && DisplayErrorAndStop "Invalid memory type '$3' specified (Virtual, Resident, ResidentAnonymous, ResidentShared, Swap, Used, Shared, Code, Data)."
  echo "Waiting for memory allocation to reach the specified threshold (PID = $1, $MEMORY_TYPE = $2 KB)."
  while : ; do
    local MEMORY_ALLOCATION=$(GetMemoryAllocation $3 $1)
    if [ "$MEMORY_ALLOCATION" == "" ]; then
      return -1;
    fi
    if (( $MEMORY_ALLOCATION >= $2 )); then
      echo "Memory allocation threshold reached (PID = $1, $MEMORY_TYPE = $MEMORY_ALLOCATION KB)."
      return 0;
    fi
    echo "Current memory allocation (PID = $1, $MEMORY_TYPE = $MEMORY_ALLOCATION KB)."
    sleep $FLAG_INTERVAL
  done
}
```

The `WaitForMemoryAllocationThreshold()` function will keep checking the memory statistic threshold and once reached it will return success (`0`).

Last, we can run the final script to capture the memory spike core dump using:

```CreateDump.sh -n ByteZoo.Blog.App -m 100000 -interval 1 --memoryType Used```

Output:
```
Waiting for memory allocation to reach the specified threshold (PID = 3438, Used (VmRSS + VmSwap) = 100000 KB).
Current memory allocation (PID = 3438, Used (VmRSS + VmSwap) = 63241 KB).
Current memory allocation (PID = 3438, Used (VmRSS + VmSwap) = 64856 KB).
Current memory allocation (PID = 3438, Used (VmRSS + VmSwap) = 66654 KB).
Memory allocation threshold reached (PID = 3438, Used (VmRSS + VmSwap) = 100932 KB).
.NET Core dump created (PID = 3438, File = './CoreDump_Full.3438').
```

The script output shows that a core dump (`CoreDump_Full.3438`) was created when exceeding the `Used` memory threshold of 100,000 KB.

## Conclusion

The goal of this article is to provide a method for capturing a core dump for memory spike troubleshooting that is the most streamlined and least invasive. It is based on existing Linux memory facilities `/proc/pid/status` or `/proc/pid/statm` and a shell script (`bash`, `sh` or similar). The script uses simple interval polling, unlike an actual memory profiler. This method can be used in most cloud or on-premise environments.

> [!NOTE]
> This approach is suitable for memory spikes with a duration of at least 100 ms. For shorter spikes, this approach might not work, or you might have to adjust the monitoring script priority.
