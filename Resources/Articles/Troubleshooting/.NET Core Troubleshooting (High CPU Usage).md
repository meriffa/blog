# .NET Core Troubleshooting (High CPU Usage)

This article outlines the steps to troubleshoot High CPU Usage issue in a .NET Core application.

## Problem

High CPU Usage is an issue where the application uses inefficient logic or is trying to overcommit processing resources. The goal of troubleshooting High CPU Usage is to identify the specific application code that needs to be reviewed and optimized.

Let's review the following sample code:

```
protected override void Execute()
{
    var tasks = new Task<int>[TaskCount];
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        tasks[i] = StartCalculationTask(1024);
    Task.WaitAll(tasks);
}

private Task<int> StartCalculationTask(int limit) => Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
{
    var i = 0;
    while (i < limit)
        i = (i + 1) % limit;
    return i;
});
```

In this scenario, the `Execute()` method calls `StartCalculationTask()` in a loop three times. The method `StartCalculationTask()` creates and starts an infinite computational task (e.g. `while (i < limit)` where `i` is always less than `limit`). As a result, there will be three threads that will have close to 100% CPU core utilization each.

Here is the `top --threads-show --pid <PID>` command output for the application running on a 4 core machine:

## Prerequisites

In order to investigate the issue, we need to take a core dump using `createdump` and load it into [LLDB](https://lldb.llvm.org/). For more details, see [Create .NET Core Dumps On Linux](/Resources/Articles/Prerequisites/Create%20.NET%20Core%20Dumps%20On%20Linux.md) and [Load .NET Core Dumps In LLDB On Linux](/Resources/Articles/Prerequisites/Load%20.NET%20Core%20Dumps%20In%20LLDB%20On%20Linux.md).

## Analysis

The overall CPU utilization in Figure 1 and the thread-specific CPU usage in particular already provide a good starting point for analysis. Before we look at the specific threads, let's review all managed application threads:

```
clrthreads
```

Output:
```
ThreadCount:      8

BackgroundThread: 7

```

The output above shows a couple of important points. The managed threads `0x0E0B`, `0x0E0D` and `0x0E0E` match the High CPU Usage threads identified in the top command output - `3595`, `3597` and `3598` respectively. These three High CPU managed threads are in `Cooperative` GC mode, which means that they are executing managed code.

> [!NOTE]
> GC Mode `Cooperative` specifies that the thread is interruptible from GC standpoint.

Next, let's focus on one of the High CPU Usage managed threads (Debugger Thread ID `11`, System Thread ID `0x0E0B`):

```
thread select 11
clrstack
```

Output:
```

00007F95811FCCA0 00007fd6b66c2934 [DebuggerU2MCatchHandlerFrame: 00007f95811fcca0]
```

The output shows that the processing is happening inside the `StartCalculationTask()` method lambda expression (source code line 43: `while (i < limit)`).

> [!NOTE]
> The last frame in the call stack is `ByteZoo.Blog.App.Controllers.Scenarios.HighCPU.CalculationController+<>c__DisplayClass5_0.<StartCalculationTask>b__0()`, which specifies a lambda method `b__` inside a closure class `c__` inside regular class `CalculationController`.

If we look at the stack trace for the other two High CPU Usage threads (Debugger Thread IDs `13` & `14`, System Thread IDs `0x0E0D` & `0x0E0E`), we will see that the processing is happening in the same lambda expression.

## Conclusion

The analysis shows, that the High CPU Usage is a result of multiple `StartCalculationTask()` method instances running in parallel and specifically the `while` loop code inside that method.

There are several potential solutions to a High CPU Usage issue:

* Optimize or replace the inefficient application logic. E.g. replace event polling with event notification or use a more efficient algorithm.
* Limit the number of parallel tasks to prevent overcommitting CPU resources.

> [!NOTE]
> Application logic optimization is not applicable in this case, since the sample code is specifically designed to cause maximum CPU utilization (it also causes Application Hang due to an infinite loop). The only solution is to limit the number of parallel tasks that does not exceed the number of CPU cores on the test machine.
